Hello mate! This is me, MrXcrypt, and welcome to my digital garden.

This space is a curated archive of my study notes, research, and explorations in Cybersecurity. I also include my medium blogs here which are free in medium. You can view my medium blogs over [here](https://medium.com/@misterxcrypt).

It’s a growing repository where I document what I learn, break things apart, and put them back together—sometimes better, sometimes just to understand them deeper.

My interests revolve around:

- Cyber Threat Intelligence – Tracking threat actors, scams, and financial fraud.
- OSINT & Social Engineering – Gathering intelligence from the wild.
- Cybercrime Research – Understanding fraud at scale.

This digital garden is my evolving map of knowledge—scattered, structured, and always growing. Feel free to explore! 🚀

An Easter egg 🥚. I hid my poetry self somewhere in this website 👀.
